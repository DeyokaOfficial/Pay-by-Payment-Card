# Project Title
Pay By Payment Card

# Zuri Team Continuous Development Basic Test
   In the realm of front-end development, there's a crucial expectation for developers to excel in both crafting code and harnessing the power of frameworks when necessary. This task specifically entails the creation of a card payment page, and it emphasizes the use of pure and unadulterated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the entire interface and handle the interactive features required for processing card payments.
   In essence, this challenge calls for a developer to use their coding skills to construct the user interface and employ JavaScript for the functionality, without resorting to any external libraries or frameworks. It showcases the ability to work with fundamental web technologies to create a practical and user-friendly payment page.

5. Pull upstream to get up to date with the original repo:<br/>
    `git pull upstream main`
6. Create a new branch for the task you are working on:<br/>
    `git checkout -b branchName`<br/>
    *(Make sure your branchName is descriptive in context to the feature you are working on. Also be sure to check which branch you are on using `git status` before you begin working)*
7. When you're done with your task, do:<br/>
    `git add`<br/>
   - Commit your work with a message:<br/>
   `git commit -m "message"`
8. To avoid conflicts:<br/>
    `git pull upstream main`
9. Then push your branch:<br/>
    `git push origin branchName` - This creates the branch remotely and pushes to that branch on the GitHub
10. Go to GitHub and create a new pull request to the main branch. It will then be reviewed and merged into the master.
